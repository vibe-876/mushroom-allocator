# mushroom-allocator
I wanted to have a better understanding of how the various _alloc functions, the heap data structure, and operating system memory managment in general worked, so I'm writing this.

This is part of a long term project called Mushroom, which is an operating system.

As with most of my projects, you probably don't want to use this.


## ToDo
- Come up with a better name for this.
